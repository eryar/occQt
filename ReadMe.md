Building occQt on Linux
=======================
First you need the qt and Mesa/OpenGL development files:
sudo apt-get install qt5-default qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools qtcreator  libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev

For Open CASCADE Official Edition
---------------------------------
1. Build Open CASCADE from source with CMake(https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt_dev_guides__building_cmake.html);
2. Build occQt with Qt Creator;


For Open CASCADE Community Edition
----------------------------------
Then from the FreeCad ppa (make sure you have http://ppa.launchpad.net/freecad-maintainers/freecad-daily/ubuntu in your apt sources list):
sudo apt-get install oce-draw liboce-modeling-dev liboce-ocaf-dev 

Building occQt on Windows
=========================

For QtCreator
-------------------------------
Open the occQt.pro from the Qt menu and set 
the  variable CASROOT  Opencascade installation path

For VisualStudio
-------------------------------
First you need the qt-vs-addin, you can download it from here: http://download.qt.io/archive/vsaddin/
open th occQt.pro and set the  variable CASROOT  Opencascade installation path
then open the occQt.pro from the Qt menu in the Visual Studio.

Note
====
1. Demonstrate the operations for the OpenCASCADE viewer, such as pan, zoom and rotate;
   the view manipulate mainly by the middle button of the mouse, and left button is used
   to pick and select;
2. Demonstrate the primitive shape construction algorithms usage, such as box, cone, 
   sphere, cylinder and torus creation;
3. Demonstrate some modeling algorithms, such as prism, revol, loft and fillet, chamfer;
4. Demonstrate boolean operations, such as cut, fuse and common;
5. Demonstrate the helix algorithms;
6. Enjoy!
